# Homie

Homie is a mobile app built with React Native and Redux that allows users to store information on their home appliances and important people. Users can input details such as the brand, model, purchase date, warranty information, and more for each of their appliances and as for their family and friends they can keep track of birthdays, hospital appointments and more.
